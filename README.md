# YOLO - Fast detection  

This repository contains our YOLOv8n-based Kaggle Notebook solution for the **BYU - Locating Bacterial Flagellar Motors 2025** competition.
üìì **Kaggle Notebook:** [YOLO - Fast detection](https://www.kaggle.com/code/roeiya/yolo-fast-detection/edit)

Our approach uses a 2D object detection model (**YOLOv8n**, Ultralytics) to detect bacterial motors in cryo-electron tomograms.  
The pipeline includes preprocessing, training, and inference with a 3D distance-based NMS to improve final predictions.


---

## Model Architecture  
The architecture is based on the Ultralytics YOLOv8 framework with pretrained weights (`yolov8n.pt`).  
The model was fine-tuned on a custom YOLO-formatted dataset derived from the competition data.

## üìã Prerequisites
Required Kaggle inputs:
- `/kaggle/input/byu-locating-bacterial-flagellar-motors-2025`
- `/kaggle/input/parse-data/yolo_dataset`

**Competition Data:**
/kaggle/input/byu-locating-bacterial-flagellar-motors-2025/
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train_labels.csv
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_submission.csv
```
**YOLO Dataset (Parsed Data):**
/kaggle/input/parse-data/yolo_dataset/
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ val/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ labels/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ val/
```

> If the `val` folders are missing, the script will automatically create an **80/20 train/val split**.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
In the **first cell** of your Kaggle Notebook, run:
```
    !pip install ultralytics==8.3.0
```
Then simply click **Run All** in Kaggle ‚Äî no further installation or internet connection is required.

## üöÄ Usage  
---

### 1. Preprocessing  
Checks and fixes dataset paths, and creates validation split if needed.
```python
from yolo_fast_detection import prepare_dataset
yaml_path = prepare_dataset()
```

---

### 2. Training  
Runs YOLOv8 training with the hyperparameters below.  
A full run on an NVIDIA T4 GPU with 150 epochs takes around 1‚Äì1.5 hours.

```python
from yolo_fast_detection import train_yolo_model
model, results = train_yolo_model(
    yaml_path="fixed_dataset.yaml",
    pretrained_weights_path="yolov8n.pt",
    epochs=150,
    batch_size=16,
    img_size=640
)
```

**Hyperparameters**  
- **Optimizer**: AdamW  
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001  
- **Epochs**: 150  
- **Batch Size**: 16  
- **Early Stopping**: Patience = 8 epochs  
- **Loss Function**: Box Loss, Classification Loss, Distribution Focal Loss  
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.45  
- **3D NMS Distance**: 60 px  

---

## 3. Inference & Submission
This step runs automatically in Kaggle when you **Run All** ‚Äî performs inference on the test set, and saves `submission.csv` to `/kaggle/working/`.  
Upload this file as your competition submission.
